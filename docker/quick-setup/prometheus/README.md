# Monitoring with Prometheus

To test the **Prometheus scrapping endpoint**, you can call, for example, `http://localhost:18092/_node/metrics/prometheus` to see values.

## How to run ?

⚠️ You need a license file to be able to run Enterprise Edition of APIM. Do not forget to add your license file into `./.license`.

`APIM_VERSION={APIM_VERSION} nerdctl compose up -d ` 

To be sure to fetch last version of images, you can do
`export APIM_VERSION={APIM_VERSION} && nerdctl compose down -v && nerdctl compose pull && nerdctl compose up`

## Prometheus Dashboard

Here is a quick access to access the Prometheus dashboard to see the JVM memory consumption:

http://localhost:9090/graph?g0.expr=jvm_memory_max_bytes&g0.tab=0&g0.stacked=0&g0.show_exemplars=0&g0.range_input=1h
