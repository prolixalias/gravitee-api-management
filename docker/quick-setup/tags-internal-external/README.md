# Internal & External Sharding tags

Here is a nerdctl compose to run APIM with two gateways:
 - One configured with sharding tag `internal`. It will only sync APIs configured for this tag. To use this gateway, call your API with `http://localhost:8082/myapi`.
 - One configured with sharding tag `external`. It will only sync APIs configured for this tag. To use this gateway, call your API with `http://localhost:8081/myapi`.

## How to run ?

⚠️ You need a license file to be able to run Enterprise Edition of APIM. Do not forget to add your license file into `./.license`.

`APIM_VERSION={APIM_VERSION} nerdctl compose up -d ` 

To be sure to fetch last version of images, you can do
`export APIM_VERSION={APIM_VERSION} && nerdctl compose down -v && nerdctl compose pull && nerdctl compose up`
